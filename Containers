* Docker is a platform that helps us manage the creation and managing our containers.

// Docker image - When we have an application that we want to deploy, we can package it into a Docker Image. 
                The image contains all of your code and dependencies.
                
// Docker instance - an ephemeral running instance of a docker image

// Dockerfile - defines the steps to create a docker image
