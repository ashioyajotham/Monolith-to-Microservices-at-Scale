//Microservices - independently deployed services that communicate with one another through networks
//Monoliths - self-contained applications that are deployed as one unit

How is a monolith similar to a large department store?
* Convenience of handling everything in one area
* Ease of sharing resources across different services


// Deploying code is the act of releasing code changes to an environment

Factors to consider before Code Deployment
* Downtime
* Downstream effects
* Ease of deployment
* Potential bugs


When not to Use Microservices
* System complexity
* Network latency
* DIfficulty with debugging



Microservice Benefits

  * Scale Lean applications that are able to tailor their logic and infrastructure to their specific business needs. 
    More-easily architected for horizontally scaling.
  * Development in Parallel Teams can develop and deploy their own codebases.
  * Cost-Effectiveness Utilize resources only for what is necessary for the specific microservice.
  * Flexibility Choose technologies that make the most sense for the team and business.
  
  
Properties of Microservices
  * Communication (REST)
  * Independently deployed
  * Fault tolerance
