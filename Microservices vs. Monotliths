//Microservices - independently deployed services that communicate with one another through networks
//Monoliths - self-contained applications that are deployed as one unit

How is a monolith similar to a large department store?
* Convenience of handling everything in one area
* Ease of sharing resources across different services


// Deploying code is the act of releasing code changes to an environment

Factors to consider before Code Deployment
* Downtime
* Downstream effects
* Ease of deployment
* Potential bugs


When not to Use Microservices
* System complexity
* Network latency
* DIfficulty with debugging
